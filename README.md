Torque-assist "wrench" for a Yeti cooler drain plug

I am a big fan of the Yeti concept.  Maximum insulation in a cooler is an awesome thing.
However, the drain plug in our series (an older model) was difficult to close completely. 
After several leak events, I took to having to use a wrench to tighten the plug.  The
caveat to this is, you needed a wrench to then remove it later.  Eventually, I came up
with the idea of 3D-printing a "knob" (the best description I've been able to come up
with) that made it much easier to sufficiently torque and un-torque the drain plug.

The size of the "knob" could be reduced, but it has a very nice "feel" and works well,
so I am not inclined to modify it.

There are two STL files included: one with a "chevron" lanyard tab, and one with a flat-
top and hole for a lanyard cord.  The "flat" version requires some means to retain a cord
(e.g., a knot) that would connect to a clip that would be used to attach the assembly
to the cooler handle when not in use.
